Primary Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze an HR analytics dataset to gain insights into employee attrition and identify factors that contribute to employee retention. This will help HR departments to create better employee retention strategies and reduce the cost of replacing employees.

Solution:
To achieve this goal, we will first collect the HR analytics dataset, which includes information such as employee demographics, job details, performance metrics, and reasons for leaving. We will preprocess and clean the data, including handling missing values and outliers, and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis.

Next, we will use Excel and SQL to perform data analysis, including calculating descriptive statistics, identifying correlations between variables, and creating pivot tables and charts to visualize the data. We will also use SQL to join different tables and extract relevant data for analysis.

We will then use Tableau to create data visualizations such as heat maps, bar charts, and scatter plots to identify patterns and trends in employee attrition and factors that contribute to employee retention. We will also use Tableau to create interactive dashboards that can be used to explore the data and gain insights into employee attrition.
